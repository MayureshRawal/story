Creating a local repository on our PC.

first we create a folder and then initiliaze git in the folder using
"git init"
2. we can check what files in the folder are not in the staging area by using "git status"
3. we can then stage them using "git add filename" or simple "git add ." to include all the files in the directory

Staging area is important for us to figure out what files to commit and what not.

4. finally we can commit the staging files in the repository using -m is for message (git commit -m "Initial Commit" )
5. We can then view the commits using "git log"

6. "git diff filename" will let us know the difference in the file 

7. We can go back to previous version of the file  using "git checkout filename"
